                  For over 25 years, Jackson-Triggs has been a proud cornerstone
                  of the Okanagan wine community, crafting the Reserve VQA wines
                  you know and love for their exceptional taste and quality.
                  This past season, severe winter conditions weather brought an
                  unprecedented cold snap to the region, causing devastating
                  losses to our vineyards and impacting the wine industry
                  throughout the Okanagan Valley.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Despite these challenges, our commitment to delivering
                  great-tasting wines remains unwavering. In true Canadian
                  spirit, we have risen to the occasion, crafting this
                  exceptional 2024 vintage with the same dedication to taste
                  that defines Jackson-Triggs. By carefully sourcing grapes
                  primarily from the Pacific Northwest wine region, we’ve
                  ensured this vintage continues to deliver the smooth,
                  flavourful profile you’ve come to expect and enjoy in every
                  glass.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As we work closely with our local growers to rebuild and
                  restore the Okanagan vineyards, we invite you to celebrate
                  this resilient vintage, a testament to our passion for
                  great-tasting wines and the spirit of our winemaking
                  community. We truly appreciate your support and understanding
                  as we navigate this unique year. Together, we’ll toast to
                  brighter seasons ahead!

                  A Challenging Season, A Commitment to the Future

                  <p>
                    In January 2024, the Okanagan experienced one of its coldest
                    winters on record, with temperatures dropping below -20°C
                    for an extended stretch. This deep freeze caused significant
                    damage to vineyards and led to major crop losses across the
                    region.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    While it’s been a tough season, it’s also a reminder of the
                    resilience and dedication that define BC’s winemaking
                    community. At Jackson-Triggs, we remain committed to
                    crafting high-quality Canadian wines and continuing the
                    legacy we’re proud to be part of.

                        Frost-related challenges have impacted most BC wineries
                        this year, with the Okanagan Valley region seeing aover

                      <p>
                        At Jackson Triggs, this meant we weren’t able to produce
                        our white and rosé wines from the 2024 harvest.
                        Thankfully, our 2023 VQA Okanagan red wines came from a
                        strong vintage, and these will continue to be available
                        on shelves through most of this year.

                        Through the “Crafted in BC” initiative, our winemaker

                        By partnering with trusted growers and wineries outside
                        of BC, we created our 2024 Winemaker’s Series—wines that
                        reflect the same quality and character you’ve come to
                        expect. We loved crafting these special editions and are
                        excited for you to enjoy them.

                        This is a short-term solution that allows us to continue
                        delivering the wines you love while our vineyards
                        recover. The good news? Over the next 18 months, we’re
                        expecting a strong comeback as we replant and restore
                        our vines.

                        Our passion is firmly rooted in the Okanagan, and we’re
                        looking forward to crafting wines from our home soil
                        again soon. In the meantime, we’re proud to share our
                        2024 release—a vintage made with care, and with the same
                        quality, balance, and flavor you’ve come to expect.

                        We know our wines have a place in your glass—and in your
                        moments. As we faced the challenges of this vintage, one
                        thing guided us: staying true to the wines you know and
                        love.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        To do that, we teamed up with trusted partners in the
                        Pacific Northwest*, regions that grow varietals similar
                        to those in BC. With skilled grape growers and
                        winemakers who share our passion for quality, we
                        carefully sourced fruit that meets our high standards.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        From there, our winemaking team took over—bringing their
                        expertise and care to every step, ensuring this vintage
                        delivers the signature flavour, balance, and taste you
                        expect. A different path this year, but the same
                        exceptional experience.

                        Our 2024 vintage has been primarily sourced from the
                        Pacific Northwest wine region, in full compliance with
                        approved government labeling regulations. A small
                        portion of Canadian grapes, sourced from Ontario, has
                        been included in each of our wines. This was done under
                        the framework of the Crafted in Canada (do we mean
                        Crafted in BC?) program and was purposefully executed to
                        complement and enhance each wine’s profile during the
                        final stages of production.
